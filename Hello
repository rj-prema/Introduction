Hey! This is my first repository (ever).
I don't know much about it but I am trying.
I had my Github Account last year but I was not able to explore it that well.
I guess I was lazy to learn something new. But now I am trying.
This time I won't be lazy. I will learn, learn something new and practice it regularly.
